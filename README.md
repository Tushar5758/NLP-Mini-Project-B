# Equipment Maintenance Scheduling using NLP

## Course: NLP (Semester 6) - Pillai College of Engineering  

### Project Overview
This project is part of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) course for Semester 6 students at Pillai College of Engineering. The objective of this project is to develop a classification model that categorizes equipment maintenance requests based on their priority. We employ various machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and transformer-based models to predict the urgency of maintenance requests based on textual descriptions. The project involves text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and comparative analysis of different models.

## Project Title
Equipment Maintenance Scheduling using Natural Language Processing

## Project Abstract
The Equipment Maintenance Scheduling project focuses on classifying maintenance requests based on their priority using NLP techniques. The project explores multiple machine learning and deep learning techniques, including traditional ML models (logistic regression, random forest, SVM, decision tree, KNN), deep learning architectures (CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM), and transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa). The goal is to determine the best model for accurately classifying maintenance requests based on textual descriptions.

### Deep Learning Algorithms
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Bi-Directional LSTM (BiLSTM)
- CNN + BiLSTM Hybrid Model

### Large language model
- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Approach)

## Key Observations & Challenges
- Large language model performed better than traditional ML models due to their strong contextual understanding.
- Uneven class distribution affected model performance but was handled relatively well by transformers.
- Large language model required significantly more computational resources compared to ML and DL models.

## Potential Improvements & Future Work
- Further training on domain-specific data can improve model accuracy.  
- Generating more data can help balance classes and enhance performance.  
- Combining BERT & RoBERTa with deep learning models can boost overall prediction accuracy.  

## Conclusion
The project successfully implemented and analyzed various machine learning, deep learning, and transformer-based models for classifying equipment maintenance requests. While traditional models provided a baseline, deep learning and transformer models captured contextual meaning more effectively. Challenges such as class imbalance and computational complexity were observed, highlighting the need for further fine-tuning and data augmentation. The study demonstrates how NLP can enhance maintenance scheduling, paving the way for more efficient automated systems.
